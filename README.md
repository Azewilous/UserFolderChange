# UserFolderChange
Makes large changes to folders simpler, many GUI changes to come, including other funtionality additions.

By Hovering over the components in the GUI a tooltip will show.

..Would also like to add that I only tested this on windows, and not sure how the OSX file system works so I wouldn't run the program on there.
